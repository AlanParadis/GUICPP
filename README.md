# GUICPP

## GUI Library made using SFML and C++

It's a one file include library, just include add `#include "GUI.h"` and you good to go

[Doxygen documentation](https://alanparadis.github.io/GUICPP/)

It's a modern C++20 port of the C library I used to make the UI on a school game project I've worked on called [Naukar](https://deus-games-studio.itch.io/naukar).

The original C library was heavily inspiered by the [TGUI library](https://tgui.eu/).
